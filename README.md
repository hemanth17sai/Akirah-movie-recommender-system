Description:
We, a team of enthusiastic computer geeks have developed this movie recommended system. and we named it as Akirah Movie Recommended System. in this GUI you can choose for the algorithm you want to search your movies with and as soon as enter the algorithm(of course you won't be asked for the algorithm but, you have to choose the type of movie recommendations you want to get i.e based on the extent of your affinity towards movies) and the movie posters will be displayed for your recommendations by the system.We three of us have no clue about tkinter or the any of the 3 algorithms initially, but we've learnt all of them and developed this project with great love and enthusiasm.
We Implemented basic Recommender system and Content Based Recommender System, and Colloborative Recommender System. where the Basic Recommender system gives the recommendations based on ratings in Imdb and the genre(either of the specific filter is available too). Content Based Recommender system gives the recommendations based on the content you've previously consumed, and finally the Colloborative Recommender System gives the recommendations based on the movies like minded people like you have watched and liked.  
We genuinely hope you enjoy the movies that we're gonna (Our System :P) Recommend you guys.So sit back and grab your popcorn!!
P.S:- Akirah means a gentle flower in Arabic.
